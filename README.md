  The Budget Tracker is a progressive web app deployed on Heroku that allows the suer to make updates to their budget on-line and off-line. When the budget item is entered into the form the Budget Tracker updates a Mongo database. When the app is off-line, items entered in the form are cached. When the user goes on-line, the cached items are reutnred to the mongo database and stored.
